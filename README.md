# Auto Degree Determinig Polynomial Fit Project

This project is a **Polynomial Regression Fitting Tool** that allows you to:
- Input your own `x` and `y` values.
- Automatically determine the **best polynomial degree** using the **RÂ² score**.
- View the resulting **LaTeX equation** of the polynomial.
- Visualize the **best-fit polynomial curve** alongside your data points.

## ðŸš€ Features
- âœ… Accepts **custom data points** entered by the user.  
- âœ… Automatically selects the **optimal polynomial degree** (avoiding overfitting).  
- âœ… Displays the **polynomial equation in LaTeX format** for easy use in reports/papers.  
- âœ… Provides the **RÂ² score** as a goodness-of-fit measure.  
- âœ… Plots both **data points** and the **best-fit curve** with `matplotlib`.
